CSS : cascading style sheet

Cascading here is the importance of the css rules and their order

css commands have importance in 4 aspects :
Position
Specificity
Type 
Importance

Position : li{
    color : red;
    color : blue;
}
here the blue color will be applied because it is further down

Specificity : 
for eg : <li id = "first_id" class="first_class" draggable>
li{color : blue;} // this is least specific
.first_class{color : red;} // this is more specific than element selector
li[draggable]{color : purple;} // this is more specific than class selector
#first_id{color : orange;} // this is the most specific selector

Type : 
inline is the most important 
then comes the internal
then the external

Importance :

color : red;
color : blue !important; if we add this important then it will ensure that this is the most important rule

Combining CSS selectors :

eg : <p>Yellow text</p>
    <div class = "box inner-box">
        <p>White Text</p>

    </div>

    p{
        color : yellow;
    }
    .inner-box p{ // here we selected p element with inner-box class thus Combining element and class selector
        color : white;
    }
Group selector : selector, selector{
                        attribute : value;
                    }

Child selector : selector > selector{  // the first selector is the parent and the second selector is the child
                        color : black;
                    }

Descendant selector :
selector selector{
    color : black;
}

Chaining selector :
selectorselector{
    color : black;
}
usually used to combine/chain all the selectors about a specific element and apply the changes

we can also combine these above combiners thus combining combiners selector
