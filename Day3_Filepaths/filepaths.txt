There are 2 file paths :

Absolute file path : the file path from the root the end of the destination
                     eg : c:/folder1/folder2/image.png

Relative file path : it is relative to something
                     eg : if you are writing a html file and you want to acces an image, but its in the folder inside the where html
                     file is then we can specify a relative position of that image

                     but we can write it as :
                     ./dog.png look inside the current directory and find the image
                     ../dog.png to go up a level to find this image
