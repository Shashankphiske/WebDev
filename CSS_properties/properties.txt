1) font-size :
h1
{
    font-size: 20px;
}
here, 1pixel is 1/96th inch or 0.26mm
1pt or 1point is 1/72nd of an inch 0.35mm
em size : it is relative to the parent of the object that we are applying it to eg:
    <body> // if body is 20px
        <h1>Hello</h1> then if h1 is set to 1em then it will also become 20px or 2em then 40px
    </body>

rem size : it is relative to the root
commonly root is html tag

Bold : font-weight 

border : this property takes in three values provided with space in between them
        border : 10px solid black;

        we can added further sub border : border-top : 0px; indent them under the border
        this all sub properties can be added into one to create : border-width :opx 10px 20px 30px
        first value is top , second is right, third is bottom and the fourth is the left

padding : it pushes the border out by pixels 
          padding : 20px; this will add space in between the element and border
margin : it creates and empty space outside of the border
        margin : 10px;

box model : height, width, padding, border, and margin all create a box model

content div elements : <div></div> created to act as an empty box for the content go in between
