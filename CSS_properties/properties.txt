1) font-size :
h1
{
    font-size: 20px;
}
here, 1pixel is 1/96th inch or 0.26mm
1pt or 1point is 1/72nd of an inch 0.35mm
em size : it is relative to the parent of the object that we are applying it to eg:
    <body> // if body is 20px
        <h1>Hello</h1> then if h1 is set to 1em then it will also become 20px or 2em then 40px
    </body>

rem size : it is relative to the root
commonly root is html tag
