eg :
<h1> Shashank </h1>
<h2> Phiske </h2>
this will display those in 2 separate lines thus we will use display property here
h2{
    display : inline;
}
this will print them in same line, by default it is set to block

another one is display : inline-block; this will allow us to set a height and width of the element and also allow other elements inline to it

another one is none : it will make any element on the screen disappear

Using the float property we can make our text wrap around our image
float : left ; this is an example
use this float property on image
if we want our part of text to behave normaly then we will apply clear property to our text
eg : clear : left/right /etc;
