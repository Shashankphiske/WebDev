there are 3 ways of adding css:
inline
internal
external

inline will go in the same line as a particular html element 
eg : <html style = "background:blue"> </html>   
"background:blue" is called value part and the background here is called property you want to change and blue here is the value that you
want it to change it to
The drawback is we would want to add it to each and every line to change it according to our requirements   
only use for specific lines or testing or one line

internal css works with a special html tag called style element
eg:
<style>
    html // this is called a selector and css goes in between {}
    {
        backgrond:red
    }
</style>
we shoudlnt use internal css if we are building a multipage website

external css lives inside a complete separate file xyz.css
inside this we write our selector and its properties and values
to add it to our html file we will add a link element which is self closing tag
eg:
<link
    rel="stylesheet" // this specifies the relationship or role of this that we are linking to 
    href="xyz.css" // where is it located   
/>
most commonly used in web development

css selector : it is the part which selects html elements to apply our properties and values to it in css
selector are of different types:
1] element selector :
    eg :
    h1
    {
        color:red //apply it to all h1 element
    }

2] class selector : it can be applied to many html elements
    eg:
    .red-heading
    {
        color:red
    }

3] id selector: selects elements with particular id attribute
                id element should be applied to only one element in the html file
    eg:
    #main
    {
        color:red   
    }

4] attribute selector :
eg:
 p[dragable] // p is the para elenent and dragable is the attribute that we want to select
 {
    color:red
 }

5] universal selector : it means select all
eg:
*
{
    color:red
}
